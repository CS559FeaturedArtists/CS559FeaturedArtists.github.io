Requirement #1. Moveable camera exist. The motion can be triggered by manipulation of a camera slider.

Requirement #2. The 3D bouncing speakers with their multiple parts adds hierarchy to the scene. Furthermore, the
dynamic nature of the pen positions (penPositions) and their rendering as a 3D curve can be interpreted as a form of
hierarchy,where each point depends on the previous one for its position.

Requirement #3. The camera "spins around" the whole scene". The speaker objects and the way they are manipulated and
drawn in 3D space, along with the parametric curve, ensure that the scene is distinctly 3D. The drawCurve() function,
which visualizes a moving curve in 3D space,adds to the 3D nature of the scene.

Requirement #4. The camera uses a projection transform (perspective). However, p5.js does not allow directly
applying transformation matrices onto the WEBGL renderer. Therefore, I had to use p5.js's camera() and perspective()
functions with the appropriate parameters derived from the glMatrix matrices.

Requirement #5. The program uses a parametric curve to update the positions of the pen. This is seen in the
updatePenPositions() function, where the pen's next position is calculated using a combination of sine and cosine
functions, which are classic examples of parametric equations. This curve is then rendered in 3D space.

I hope the integration of sounds with curve formation and manipulation of sound frequency to create different curves
along with added 3D bouncing speakers and the scenes's ability to move 360 with the camera while maintaining hierarchy
qualifies this project for a full 4 grade.
